You can **reshape the game** to your liking with ease.

### 2. **Advanced Script Execution**

### 4. **Real-Time Environment Control**
Take control of the in-game environment with real-time modifications:
- Change the time of day, weather, or map layout

Craft your own cheats and use them to **break the game** in new ways.

### 7. **Cross-Game Compatibility**
LuaQ is compatible with a wide variety of Lua-based games. From small indie projects to larger multiplayer games, LuaQ ensures that you can hack, mod, and customize **across a broad range of platforms**.

### 8. **Upcoming Features: Roblox Game Downloading & Server Access**
One of the most anticipated features of LuaQ is the ability to **download entire Roblox games**, including:
- **Accessing Server Storage**: LuaQ will allow users to interact with and modify content stored in the Roblox server storage, which is typically protected from direct access.
- **Downloading and Modifying Protected Data**: LuaQ will provide tools to bypass certain protections in Roblox, allowing you to download and modify game assets and scripts that are normally restricted or locked.
